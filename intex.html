    <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
    <p>This page is to introduce myself and share some things about me.</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I Graduated from Hurricane High in 2019.</p>
    <p>I attend Brigham Young University. I am studying Cybersecurity and expect to graduate in 2027. I started at Utah Tech before transferring to BYU.</p>
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I like tinkering with technology. For example, I found a network music streaming box and took it apart. I connected to its serial port to poke around.</p>
    <p>Playing around with different linux distros has been a hobby of mine off and on. Now I mostly use wsl and live environments for quick tasks, as windows only software is often required.</p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I enjoy watching movies. I like historical, biographies, comedies, and scifi.</p>
    <p>I also like playing casual ultimate frisbee and disc golf. </p>
